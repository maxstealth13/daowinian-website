            <p>The Guild system is the organizational heart of the Decentralised Keiretsu. Each Guild represents a specialized community focused on a specific domain or skill set, working together toward common goals while maintaining their unique identity and expertise.</p>
            
            <p>Guilds function as semi-autonomous units within the broader DK network, with their own leadership, projects, and revenue streams. This structure allows for specialized focus and expertise while benefiting from the collective resources, support, and network effects of the entire ecosystem.</p>
            
            <p>The DK currently comprises 30 specialized Guilds, each playing a vital role in the overall network. When you join the DK, you'll be guided through a process to determine which Guild best matches your skills, experience, and interests.</p>

            <h3>Guild Master</h3>
            <p>The primary leader responsible for the overall direction, strategy, and performance of the Guild. Guild Masters are elected by Guild members for fixed terms.</p>
            
            <h3>Guild Council</h3>
            <p>A small group of experienced members who work with the Guild Master to govern the Guild, make key decisions, and oversee operations.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Leaders</h3>
            <p>Members who take responsibility for specific projects or initiatives within the Guild, managing teams and resources to achieve defined objectives.</p>
            
            <h3>Mentors</h3>
            <p>Experienced members who guide and support newer members, helping them develop their skills and integrate into the Guild community.</p>

          <div className="content">
            <p>While each Guild has its specialized focus, the real power of the DK emerges through cross-Guild collaboration. Complex projects often require diverse skills and perspectives, bringing together members from multiple Guilds to form dynamic, cross-functional teams.</p>
            
            <p>The DK has established several mechanisms to facilitate this collaboration:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Marketplace:</strong> A platform where Guilds can post projects and seek collaborators from other Guilds</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-Guild Councils:</strong> Standing committees that address issues affecting multiple Guilds</li>
              <li><strong>Collaborative Workspaces:</strong> Physical and virtual environments designed for cross-Guild teamwork</li>
              <li><strong>Knowledge Exchange Programs:</strong> Structured opportunities for members to temporarily work with other Guilds</li>
              <li><strong>Network-Wide Challenges:</strong> Major initiatives that engage all Guilds in addressing significant opportunities or problems</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This collaborative approach ensures that the DK can leverage its full range of talent and expertise, creating solutions that no single Guild could develop alone.</p>
